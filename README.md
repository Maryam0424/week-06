TASK 1:
This code defines a program for managing ticket bookings at a Wildlife Park. It includes functions to display ticket options, extra attractions, and booking days. The main function acts as the entry point, presenting a welcome message and calling the display functions. Overall, the code offers a clear and structured interface for users to explore available options and make bookings at the Wildlife Park.

TASK 2:
This code presents a ticket-booking system for a Wildlife Park. It features functions to display available ticket options, extra attractions, and booking days. The core function, `process_booking()`, handles user input for ticket quantities and attractions, calculates the total cost, and generates a unique booking number. The `main()` function coordinates the program's flow, enabling users to make multiple bookings. The program offers an organized and user-friendly interface for managing Wildlife Park reservations.

TASK 3:
This code is implemented by enhancing the `process_booking()` function to ensure that each booking offers the best value to the visitor. It calculates the total cost of the booking and then checks for alternative booking options that might provide better value. For example, it suggests considering individual tickets instead of group bookings or opting for family tickets instead of a combination of adult and child tickets if it would be more cost-effective. This ensures that users can make informed decisions to maximize cost-effectiveness when booking tickets at the Wildlife Park.
